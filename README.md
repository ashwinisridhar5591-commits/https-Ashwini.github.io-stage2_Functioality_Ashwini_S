# images/ README — Add your original Jain University photos

Place original Jain University photos in this folder. By default the site expects these filenames (used in index and initial gallery):

- https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.E3JLb0y0zrxOz3UfYdV3QQHaDL?w=294&h=150&c=7&r=0&o=7&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7&rm=3.jpg  — Central lawn / hero image
- Stage2_Functionality_Ashwini.S.zip/files/images/.jpg  — Academic block
- Stage2_Functionality_Ashwini.S.zip/files/images/.jpg  — Library / study spaces
- Stage2_Functionality_Ashwini.S.zip/files/images/.jpg  — Student common area

Guidelines:
- Use original photos you took on Jain University campus (do NOT use copyrighted third-party images).
- Recommended width: ~1200px for good quality; compress to keep the zip small.
- Keep filenames as above or add new files and register them from admin.html → Gallery → Add (use path like `images/yourfile.jpg`).
- If you add new photos, open index.html or admin.html to confirm they appear (admin adds new gallery entries to localStorage).
