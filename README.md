# images/ README — Add your original Jain University photos

Place original Jain University photos in this folder. By default the site expects these filenames (used in index and initial gallery):

- <img width="680" height="510" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17abf4d4-6b1f-45a5-bd5c-9da405f13686" />
  — Central lawn / hero image
- <img width="1024" height="576" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/699fec27-fd8c-4e1a-b0c4-98c8343b5af7" />
  — Academic block
-  <img width="773" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cdd74cb-9d7b-4d36-8ecb-310ee947fc0d" />
 — Library / study spaces
- <img width="474" height="316" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be8c0b6d-9eaf-4704-9ea4-c1165eb5a425" />
  — Student common area

Guidelines:
- Use original photos you took on Jain University campus (do NOT use copyrighted third-party images).
- Recommended width: ~1200px for good quality; compress to keep the zip small.
- Keep filenames as above or add new files and register them from admin.html → Gallery → Add (use path like `images/yourfile.jpg`).
- If you add new photos, open index.html or admin.html to confirm they appear (admin adds new gallery entries to localStorage).
